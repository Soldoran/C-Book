# First README.md file I created

There is nothing special in here so far
In order to better understand the C programming language, I decided to get myself a beginners book, to help with my studies.

So I'll use this repo to organize upcoming coding tasks and challenges in this book, to also learn more about Git and GitHub, how to version control, how to structure projects, how to make and design a decent ReadMe.MD.

## Projectlist
* Exercise 1:	Divided by..
* Exercise 2:	loops
* Exercise 3:	loops / nested loops
* Exercise 4:	structs (Chapter about structs was abruptly cut off, when starting to explain what comes after the "."-operator)

## Final thoughts

It was my first book by Adrian R. and overall I am a little bit disappointed, even though I knew this book is for absolute beginners, which I am not.
But just that one mistake made, that the chapter about structures is so short, and that it was abruptly cut off just after a short introduction, was offsetting.
But I still did the exercises regardless, to get a better understanding of the C language. After Exercise 4, only one bonus Exercise was planned, which is to program Yahtzee in C, by using multiple .c files instead of just one main.c. Then a few pages were spend on Debugging and there this book ends.

Overall I decided for myself, that I wont bother with any other books by A. Rechsteiner and will look for something more indepth and challenging (and hopefully completed).
