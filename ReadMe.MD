# First Readme.MD file I created

There is nothing special in here so far
In order to better understand the C programming language, I decided to get myself a beginners book, to help with my studies.

So I'll use this repo to organize upcoming coding tasks and challenges in this book, to also learn more about Git and GitHub, how to version control, how to structure projects, how to make and design a decent ReadMe.MD.
